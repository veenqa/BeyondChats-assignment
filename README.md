# Reddit Persona Generator (Hugging Face Edition)
This project scrapes a Reddit user's recent comments and posts, then generates a summarized user persona using Hugging Face's transformer models like distilbart-cnn-12-6. It’s designed for research, behavioral analysis, and insight generation — all without relying on paid APIs like OpenAI or Gemini.

# Features

  Generates a behavioral summary using Hugging Face summarization models

  Saves the analysis to a .txt file (optionally exportable to PDF)

  100% open-source and API-free (no keys required for Hugging Face models)
